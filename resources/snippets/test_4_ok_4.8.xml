	<!-- Test Case 4.8: missing tableref -->
	<!-- 
	     In many instances, the annotation is satisfied by a single TEMPLATES 
	     node associated with the, usually one and only, native TABLE block. 
	     Additionally, we have found that in existing datasets, this TABLE block 
	     will often not have an assigned dmid. And so, in order to:
                * minimize the need to modify the native serialization
                * minimize the burden on annotators to explicitly define a self-evident relation
             we allow that if the tableref is missing, the TEMPLATES block refers
	     to the first TABLE.
